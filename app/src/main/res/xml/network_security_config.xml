  Network Security Configuration

  Allows HTTP communication to CCADB (Mozilla's Common CA Database) for CA certificate download.

  Security justification:
  - CCADB serves Mozilla CA bundle over HTTP (bootstrap problem: can't use HTTPS without certificates)
  - This is Mozilla's official CA certificate distribution method
  - Downloaded file is validated (size check + PEM header verification)
  - Only used during initial rootfs installation (one-time operation)
